Eden is a script-based tool for easily managing runs of many small jobs.
A list of command lines that run your jobs is all that is needed--Eden takes 
care of the rest.  Basically, Eden starts up some number of job-executing 
processes (one for each cpu requested).  These processes then execute your job 
commands in parallel, running through the list until it is exhausted.  When 
complete, Eden provides a summary file of stderr, stdout and timing information
from the individual runs.

If you have lots of small jobs to run, Eden is the tool for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two versions of Eden: one for use on a large shared-memory HPC machine
(Nautilus) in a job scheduling environment; and one for use on a small, single 
system with multiple CPUs (e.g. a typical quadcore laptop).

Please see README_nautilus for information on running Eden on Nautilus or
README_mp for information on running Eden on your laptop.
